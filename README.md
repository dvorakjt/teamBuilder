## Introduction

This app was completed as a homework for the Penn Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp. We were provided with certain boilerplate code to get us going, including the test files, and the htmlRenderer file. My task was to add javascript files containing classes that described employees and various permutations thereof that passed the tests, and then use these classes to construct an app that takes in user input and generates a visually appealing html file that lists all the members of the team the user constructed.

## Installation
![Installation Image ](./Assets/screenshots/screen-2.png)

To install the app, clone the repository and cd into its directory in the terminal. From there, run npm install to make sure all of the dependencies in the package.json file are installed. Then enter the command node app.js and the application will run. If you would like to run any of the tests, enter the command npm run test.

### Dependencies

Dependencies: Inquirer; Dev-Dependencies: Jest

## Usage
![Usage Image](./Assets/screenshots/screen-3.png)

Using the application is very straightforward. Simply open the terminal, cd into the application's directory and enter node app.js. From there, you will receive a series of prompts related to the members of your team. For each team member you will need to provide their name, email and id number. For managers, you will also need to provide their office number. For engineers, you will also need to provide their github username. For interns, you will need to provide their school. You can enter as many employees as you wish. Once you are done, a file will be saved to the output folder. One thing to note is that the background image is located a directory up, and in the Assets folder. Therefore, if you move the generated html file into a different directory, make sure to also copy the background image and update the html file with the corresponding directory. The url for the background image is found in line 13 of the generated html.

## Tests

Each of the classes in this app were tested using Jest. while building each class, I installed Jest globally so that I could test each class individually, for example "jest Engineer.test.js" I then used npm run test to test all the classes together.
